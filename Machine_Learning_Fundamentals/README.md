# Examples of Machine Learning Fundamentals with Python

## Prerequisites

For this examples is necessary:

* [Jupyter-Notebook](http://jupyter.org/)
* [numpy] (!pip install numpy)
* [pandas] (!pip install pandas)

## Running

* Part I   - Introduction to K-Nearest Neighbors.ipynb
    * In this mission, we explored the problem of predicting the optimal price to list an AirBnB rental for based on the price of similar listings on the site. We stepped through the entire machine learning workflow, from selecting a feature to testing the model. To explore the basics of machine learning, we limited ourselves to only using one feature (the univariate case) and a fixed **k** value of **5**.
* Part II  - Evaluating Model Performance.ipynb
    * In this mission, we learned how to test our machine learning models using basic cross validation and different metrics.
* Part III - Multivariate K-Nearest Neighbor.ipynb
    * In this mission, we prepared the data to be able to use more features, trained a few models using multiple features, and evaluated the different performance tradeoffs. We explored how using more features doesn't always improve the accuracy of a k-nearest neighbors model.
