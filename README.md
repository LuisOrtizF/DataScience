# Machine_Learning_Projects
This repository contains some exciting and novel ML projects.

* **Draw_Choropleth_Maps**: In this project, we work with Choropleth maps for estimate the population to Northeast Region of Brazil.

* **Gender_UFRN_Employess**: In this project, we identify the gender of each employee and visualize the gender gap using a pie graph. Also we find the first female and male names more comuns of UFRN employees.

* **Montgomery_County_Crime_Analisys**: In this project, you'll be working with crime data from Montgomery County, MD. Each row in the data is a crime reported by a law enforcement officer in 2013 and entered into a database.

* **UBER_Estimated_Times_Analysis**: In this example, the analysis of the average time it takes for a UBER car to arrive to especific point (latitude, longitude) within a neighborhood is made. The study has been carried out in the city of Natal, this metropolis belongs to the state of Rio Grande do Norte in Brazil. Data was obtained during eight days, for 3 points within each neighborhood (36 in total) of Natal. The data capture period was 4 mim because the UBER API only allows 2000 queries per hour.

## Prerequisites
